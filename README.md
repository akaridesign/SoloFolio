INSTALLATION

1. Copy theme files to wp-content/themes

2. Activate theme in WordPress dashboard.

3. Navigate to SoloFolio > General and click "update" to write initial settings to your WordPress installation. Do the same for SoloFolio > Design and SoloFolio > Gallery.

4. Under Appearance > Menus, make a menu and assign it to the home container.

5. Under Settings > Media, set the Thumbnail size to 150 (w) 100 (h), Medium size to 300 (w) 200 (h), and Large size to 900 (w) 600 (h).

6. Upload images at least 1800x1200 in size at full JPG quality, not to exceed 2mb. SoloFolio will handle the rest.
