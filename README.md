ABOUT

SoloFolio is more than a theme. The core components drastically modify the way WordPress works. Under development since 2008, SoloFolio is a cross-platform, mobile-friendly portfolio solution.

FEATURES TO NOTE

SoloFolio does a lot of work behind the scenes to present your work in the best way possible on all platforms. In order to do this, there are a few behavioral overrides you should keep in mind.

They include:

-Galleries inserted into blog posts will be forced in to the vertical scroll template.
-Tablet devices load side-scrolling galleries
-Phones load vertically scrolling galleries.
-JPG quality is locked at 90, instead of the Wordpress default of 60. This sacrifices some speed, to the benefit of image quality.

INSTALLATION

1. Copy theme files to wp-content/themes
2. Activate theme in WordPress dashboard.
3. Under Appearance > Menus, make a menu and assign it to the home container.
4. Upload images at least 1800x1200 in size at full JPG quality in sRGB, not to exceed 2mb. SoloFolio will handle the rest.

USING THE GALLERY

SoloFolio piggy-backs on the built-in WordPress gallery manager. The [gallery] shortcode will accept the following variables:

type: cycle-react slideshow, super, react, side-scroll, vert-scroll (default: cycle-react)

SLIDESHOW

autoplay : true, false (default: false)
captions : true, false (default: true)
fullscreen : true, false (default: true)
showcounter : true, false (default: true)
shownav : true, false (default: true)
showthumbnails : true, false (default: true)
