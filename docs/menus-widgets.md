# Menus & widgets
_SoloFolio does not support default menus. They must be added via the Custom Menu widget._

## Menus

Create a menu for each section of pages. For example: Home, Projects, Multimedia

## Widgets

### Custom Menus
For each menu created above, add a Custom Menu widget. The widget's Title field will display above the menu as a section header.

_Only one menu widget should be used with the Horizon layout._

### Dropdown menu
To create a dropdown menu, add a SoloFolio Dropdown Menu widget, then select one of your menus. The widget's Title field will display as the menu title, which will open the menu when clicked.

### SoloFolio Social Media
Add your social media links and they will be displayed as icons.
