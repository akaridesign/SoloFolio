Before getting started, you'll need a copy of Wordpress running on a server. Most web hosts make it easy to get an installation up and running. I recommend [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com).

1. [Download](http://github.com/joelhawksley/SoloFolio/archive/master.zip) the latest version of SoloFolio.
2. Copy the theme to `/wp-content/themes`.
3. Go to Appearance > Themes
4. Click "Activate".
